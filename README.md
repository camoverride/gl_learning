# gl_learning

Material to be shared with mentees from GL.

Each case study lives in its own directory along with the data required to run the notebook.


## Get Started

The requirements to run __all__ the notebooks are saved in `requirements.txt`

Create a conda virtual environment. Confirm that you are inside your virtual environment with `which python` and `which pip` - the path should look something like this `/Users/cameronsmith/anaconda3/envs/ENV_NAME/bin/python` where `ENV_NAME` is whatever you named the environment.

Then install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
